I'm an [Android](https://www.android.com) application developer and a [Linux](https://www.linux.org) enthusiast in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

I love spending way too much time on the computer and I like to write code. For the past few years, I followed a relentless passion for learning and writing code. Plus, I like to read articles, listen to podcasts about new technologies and innovation. I love trying new things, creating new methods, and introducing new ideas. All of this makes me believe I’m a quick learner and I feel like I know how to adapt to new environments.

Besides all of this computer nerd stuff, I like to read books *(fan of [Satyajit Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satyajit_Ray) and [Dan Brown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Brown))*, watch movies *(fan of [Harry Potter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter) and [Cosmos: A Spacetime Odyssey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmos:_A_Spacetime_Odyssey) series)*, listen to music and play computer games.

Please don't hesitate to [get in touch](/contact) if you'd like to talk.
